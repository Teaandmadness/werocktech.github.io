name: Draw My Life
bio: "DrawMyLife presents a child’s perception of migration and exile through anonymised drawings and data. Our aim is to raise awareness about the impact of migration on children’s lives among campaigners, researchers, and the wider public, and in particular to advocate for psychological support for children who have experienced trauma.
    We are doing this by designing a friendly platform for use by NGOs working with refugee children, which enables them to upload the children’s drawings and quickly add important information about age, gender, mood - and the child’s own story.  
    Making this evidence searchable is another aim of the project. We will provide simple curation tools to help our partners, Terre des Hommes, and others supporting the Destination Unknown campaign, advocate for the rights of children on the move.
    We are also working with UNOCHA to contribute to their Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) platform, and provide unique data on the psychological health of children on the move for use by NGOs, governments, and the media."
