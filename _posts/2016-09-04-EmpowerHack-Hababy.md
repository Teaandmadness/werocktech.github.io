name: Hababy
bio: "HaBaby strives to support pregnant refugees in transit. Our aim is to facilitate patient-doctor communication and make interactions with constrained medical personnel more effective and efficient. The app focuses on the ability to capture key symptoms and a lightweight patient history. It is accessible in multiple languages; Arabic and English to start. The name comes from combining the Arabic word “habibi,” meaning sweetheart or baby, with the English word “baby.” The app is being developed with partners at Doctors of the World (DOTW), Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), Muslim Doctors Association (MDA), Oxford University, and Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS)."
